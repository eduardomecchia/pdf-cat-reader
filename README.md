# App purpose
I wrote this app as a test for Octostar.
The application should let the user upload a PDF file.
Then, the app should count the words in the PDF file and display the result to the user, without counting stop words.
Additionally, if there's an image in the PDF and said image contains a cat, the app should display a message to the user.

# How to run the application
Assuming you have Streamlit installed, you can run the app by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

If you don't have Streamlit installed, you can install it by running the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```
